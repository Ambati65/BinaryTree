# 🌳 Binary Tree Problems in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental **Binary Tree** operations and problems.  
Each file focuses on a specific concept, making it easy to understand and practice tree-related algorithms.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **BinaryTree.java** → Implementation of a **Binary Tree** (insert, traverse, etc.)
- **BinaryTree.node** → Node structure used in `BinaryTree.java`
- **BfsTree.java** → Implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** traversal
- **DfsTree.java** → Implementation of **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversal
- **LCA.java** → Find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes in a Binary Tree

## 🚀 Features Implemented
- ✅ Binary Tree creation and node insertion  
- ✅ BFS Traversal (Level-order traversal)  
- ✅ DFS Traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)  
- ✅ Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) finder 
- ✅ Heigtht of tree
- ✅ Diameter of tree
- ✅ Top view of Binarytree
- ✅ Minimun Distance Between Two Nodes 
- ✅ Kth level of tree
- ✅ Check a Subtree exists in main tree
- ✅ SumTransform of tree
