## 📂 Repository Structure

- **BinaryTree.java** → Implementation of a **Binary Tree** (insert, traverse, etc.)
- **BinaryTree.node** → Node structure used in `BinaryTree.java`
- **BfsTree.java** → Implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** traversal
- **DfsTree.java** → Implementation of **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversal
- **LCA.java** → Find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes in a Binary Tree
